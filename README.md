Hospital Management System
This project is a Hospital Management System developed using Java technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages) and Servlets for the server-side logic. The frontend is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly and responsive interface. The application uses SQL for backend data storage and management, typically running on a relational database such as MySQL.

The system is designed to streamline hospital operations by enabling management of patient records, doctor appointments, staff details, and other administrative tasks. Users can log in with different roles (such as admin, doctor, or receptionist) and access relevant features based on their permissions. The application handles tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical history tracking, and staff administration.

To run this project, you need to set up a Java web server such as Apache Tomcat and configure the database (e.g., MySQL) with the appropriate schema and tables. The backend interacts with the database using JDBC. All server-side operations, such as handling form submissions, fetching data, and session management, are handled via Servlets and JSP.

This Hospital Management System is intended as a learning project or a base for more advanced development. It demonstrates key concepts in full-stack Java web development and SQL-based data handling.
